Project 1 Report: 

The app is a game that has the same logic as Rock-Paper-Scissors but instead uses a Mouse, a Cat, and an Elephant. 

The demo was used as a template. These were the changes made to it for project 1: 

- Changed the game to Mouse Cat Elephant, including the app name to be more descriptive.
  The game still follows the rules of Rock Paper Scissors. Mouse beats Elephant, Elephant beats Cat, Cat beats Mouse. The rest are draws. 

- Variable name changes to be more descriptive as well.

- Removed pointless floating action button.

- Changed the theme to be epic battle styled, complete with music and all. The music loops and I turned down the volume a bit. 
  The computer has generally more evil looking characters, this should go well with the theme.

- Added counter to show wins, losses, and draws for more indepth stats. 

- Using shared preferences we save the total stats through sessions. The user can keep progress on their stats as long as the app is installed.

- Changed the app icon to better fit the app.

- Removed sounds when clicking the characters, we just couldn't find good sounds for the animals to go with the battle theme.
